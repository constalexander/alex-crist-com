        Ever curious and always learning, my journey into software started in my
        youth during school. I discovered one day that my TI-83 scientific
        calculator had a PRGM key, which allowed me to interface with it in new
        ways. This is the exact moment my obsession with programming began.

      <p className="text-xl font-semibold italic">My appetite grows</p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        At that time, I began learning everything I could: Dreamweaver, Flash,
        Geocities, Visual Basic and even C++. I was drawn to web development the
        most, however, because of the visual feedback during the development
        process. So I learned HTML, CSS and Photoshop. I used JavaScript to add
        interactivity.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl font-semibold italic">That magic feeling</p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        There was a feeling of magic when I wrote code. You know the one, when
        you see your creation come to life because of some words you typed on a
        screen. Thinking that this was just a fun hobby, I would put this on
        hold so that I could focus on finishing high school and figuring out
        what I wanted to do with my life.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl font-semibold italic">The free internet provides</p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        Over the years, I kept pushing my own limits in web development and
        decided to attend college to learn Computer Science and make a career
        out of it. The first class was a C programming language class, so I
        turned to the internet to learn PHP, MySQL and Wordpress. Places like
        Freecodecamp and many other websites helped me become who I am today
        without ever paying tuition.
      </p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        So, after acing my first class in college, I left to pursue freelance
        contracts by offering my web development services to local businesses by
        designing and building their Wordpress websites, setting up their custom
        email accounts, and even making their business cards.

      <p className="text-xl font-semibold italic">
        Choosing JavaScript as my language of choice
      </p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        Wordpress, Laravel, and CodeIgniter were my first frameworks, and they
        were PHP based. I discovered the MVC pattern and other software design
        patterns. It was, however, clear that web development would be
        JavaScript based. Once again, I turned to the internet like MDN Web
        Docs, W3Schools, StackOverflow and so many individual blogs found
        through Google searches in order to learn JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        Most of my JavaScript learning projects have not survived, but I was
        fanatically building apps with all of this new found knowledge. I wanted
        to do this full time. My lucky break into the industry would happen in
        2020 when I was abruptly laid off from my graphic design job at the
        time. I decided that I was ready to offer my coding skills to a local
        company called Zilis, and they hired me as a Web Developer.

      <p className="text-xl font-semibold italic">
        Years of professional experience
      </p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        Since then, I have accrued years of professional experience in this
        field at companies of various sizes, teams and products. I've launched
        apps internationally and I've been recognized as "setting the standard
        for frontend developers" at companies.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl font-semibold italic">What's next</p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        Today, I'm seeking new challenges to meet and problems to solve. I would
        like to lead or work with a team of UI developers to deliver the best
        possible product, for a startup, "Little Tech" or any organization with
        a product that I resonate with. Let's connect and make something happen!
