        Ever curious and always learning, my journey into software started in my
        youth during school. I discovered one day that my TI-83 scientific
        calculator had a PRGM key, which allowed me to interface with it in new
        ways. This is the exact moment my obsession with programming began.

      <p className="text-xl font-semibold italic">My appetite grows</p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        At that time, I began learning everything I could: Dreamweaver, Flash,
        Geocities, Visual Basic and even C++. I was drawn to web development the
        most, however, because of the visual feedback during the development
        process. So I learned HTML, CSS and Photoshop.

      <p className="text-xl font-semibold italic">That magic feeling</p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        There was a feeling of magic when I wrote code. You know the one, when
        you see your creation come to life because of some words you typed on a
        screen. Thinking that this was just a fun hobby, I would put this on
        hold so that I could focus on finishing high school and figuring out
        what I wanted to do with my life.

      <p className="text-xl font-semibold italic">The free internet provides</p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        Over the years, I kept pushing my own limits in web development and
        decided to attend college to learn Computer Science and make a career
        out of it. The first class was a C programming language class, so I
        turned to the internet to learn PHP, MySQL and Wordpress. Places like
        Freecodecamp and many other websites helped me become who I am today
        without ever paying tuition.
      </p>

      <p className="font-light leading-relaxed">
        So, after acing my first class in college, I left to pursue freelance
        contracts by offering my web development services to local businesses by
        designing and building their Wordpress websites, setting up their custom
        email accounts, and even making their business cards.
