Never use git commands.

Stay true to the existing authorship, code styles, and composition in the existing codebase. When generating new code, consider how to make it an extension of the already existing code and how to stay within the same style.

Before making large, sweeping changes, ask me if I am sure if I want to continue and also remind me to commit all existing code so that I can easily back out of the changes you make by just resetting the git staging area.
